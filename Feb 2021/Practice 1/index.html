 <p class="text1">this text is affected by a "class" attribute. That specific class attribute becuase I gave the selector "p" the p element as -> p.text1 in the .CSS file. A general class attribute would have no selected element,</p>
<p> 
  <em>Just a class attribute </em> <br /> <!-- this element "em" has been selected in the CSS, the below element has a more specific class setting--> 
  <em class="emphasized secondclass">Just a class attribute</em> <!-- you can have multiple classes for one element -->

<p> this text is normal though, aka the "p" element has no class attribute. There is no p._____ css selector it is just p itself</p>

<p class="bluebenjis"> This text is has been given a class attribute. It is CSS non specific. It is a general class attribute in the .css file. All items with the class "bluebenjis" will have the bluebenjis style because the CSS has no selector </p>
